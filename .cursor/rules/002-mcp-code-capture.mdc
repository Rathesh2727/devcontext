# Code Capture and Tracking for MCP Memory

These rules ensure code changes are captured and tracked appropriately using MCP tools.

## File Change Trigger

```javascript
// Automatically capture code changes when files are modified
// Debounced by 500ms to prevent excessive calls during typing
// Target latency: <50ms for synchronous processing
onFileChange: (file) => {
  mcp_cursor10x_mcp_capture_code({
    session_id: "{{SESSION_ID}}",
    file_path: "{{FILE_PATH}}",
    code_content: "{{FILE_CONTENT}}",
    priority: "normal",
  });
};
```
